# mini-fe2io
A miniaturized version of FE2.IO written in Rust, and independent of any web browsers.
This is perfect for low end machines that can't handle playing games while having a browser open.

HUGE thanks to [@some100](https://github.com/some100) for reworking the entire code to make this work after I abandoned the project for 2 years.
